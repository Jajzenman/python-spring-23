    "1. Text analysis of **gender** from texts of your choosing or the ones provided by me.\n",
    "2. Text analysis of **monsters** from texts of your choosing or the ones provided by me.\n",
    "3. Text analysis of a topic of your choosing. \n",

    "If you choose **genders**, do the following:\n",
    "- Choose one text by a man and one text by a woman.\n",
    "- Load and clean the text using the functions defined in the `nltk: text analysis` class notes.\n",
    "- Do some text analysis using at least four NLTK methods like:\n",
    "    - `similar()`, `concordance()`, `distribution_plot([])`, `collocations()`, and `common_contexts([])`\n",
    "    - check word counts with `text.vocab().most_common(20)` \n",
    "- Write a paragraph (5 - 7 sentences) about your results, and answer the following questions:\n",
    "   - What did you discover about the way gender is portrayed across the two texts? \n",
    "   - Based on your exploration so far, what kind of further questions could you ask about the topic or data?\n",
